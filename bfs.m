function vis = bfs(A,c)
%   bfs searches the set of nodes can reach and can be reached by
%   node c using Breadth first search for undirected networks
%
%   vis = bfs(A,c)
%
%   Inputs:
%       A : Adjacency matrix of the network
%       c : the node
%
%   Outputs:
%       vis : the set of nodes can reach and can be reached by node c
